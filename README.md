# DNA Sequence Processor

## Description

This code processes DNA sequences from a text file, calculates nucleotide frequencies at each position, and determines the consensus sequence. Results, including the consensus sequence and nucleotide frequencies, are saved to an output file.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Reads DNA sequences from a text file.
- **Frequency Calculation**: Counts nucleotide frequencies at each position.
- **Consensus Sequence Generation**: Determines the most frequent nucleotide at each position.
- **Results Export**: Saves the consensus sequence and frequencies to an output file.

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Input File**: Ensure `DNAInput.txt` contains the DNA sequences.

2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script using:
   
   ```bash
   python script.py
   
4. **Check the Results**: The results will be saved in DNAOutput.txt.
   
## Requirements
  Python 3.x
